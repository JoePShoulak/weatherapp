# Weather App
A UMN Bootcamp homework assignment. A weather app, with search features, current weather, and 5-day forecast

## About
This is a portfolio project to demonstrate dynamic API calls, search handling, and more. By default, information is shown for Minneapolis, MN, but by using the search bar (and by clicking on historical results beneath it), you can quickly explore the weather of the world!
